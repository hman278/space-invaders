# space-invaders

A space invaders and asteroids game mashup created in 3 days, most of the art is done by me, music and art attributions will be given in the future.

Controls - Mouse hover to move the player, the closer the mouse to the player ship - the more accurate the movement is. Left click (hold) to fire laser.

The project code quality and performance had to be sacrified for meeting a tight 3 day completion deadline.
